Pale Male became a New York City celebrity in the 1990s. He built his nest on a ledge of a luxury apartment building overlooking Central Park. Despite initial objections from some residents, Pale Male and his mates successfully raised numerous chicks over the years, making him a symbol of urban wildlife resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "His story captured the hearts of many New Yorkers and even inspired a PBS documentary called \"Pale Male.‚Äù People gathered with binoculars and cameras to catch glimpses of this majestic bird in action. Pale Male demonstrated that even in one of the most densely populated cities in the world, nature finds a way to flourish.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Animal Jokes:\n",
      "Why do cows wear bells?\n",
      "Because their horns don't work!\n",
      "\n",
      "Why don‚Äôt lions play cards in the jungle?\n",
      "Because there are too many cheetahs!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Interesting Wildlife in New York:\n",
